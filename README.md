Breast cancer is one of the most serious health issues affecting women worldwide. Early detection is key to successful treatment and improved survival rates. In this project, we developed a deep learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using clinical data and advanced machine learning techniques.
The core of the model is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), known for its ability to identify complex, non-linear patterns in data. To enhance model performance, we also used a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection — an optimization technique inspired by natural evolution. GA helps us identify the most important features from the dataset, which improves accuracy and reduces model complexity.
The dataset we used, simplified_dataset.csv, is based on real-world clinical records and includes several health indicators relevant to breast cancer diagnosis.
